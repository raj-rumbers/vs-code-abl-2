I'll help you review Product Issue #1 for the OpenEdge ABL LSP project. Let me start by gathering the necessary information.

● List directory .
  └ 29 files found

● Get GitHub repository information
  $ cd /workspaces/vs-code-abl-2 && git remote -v
  └ 3 lines...

● Read README.md
  └ 367 lines read

● Read package.json
  └ 674 lines read

● github-mcp-server-issue_read
  └ {"id":3933604367,"number":1,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Choose Pro...

Now let me explore the codebase to understand how the project structure and check syntax functionality works:

● Explore: Explore check syntax feature
  ● Read src/debugAdapter/ablDebugConfigurationProvider.ts
    └ 45 lines read
  ● Grep "defaultProjectName" (/workspaces/vs-code-abl-2/src/extension.ts)
    └ 3 lines found

Now let me create a comprehensive directory structure for the issue review:

● Create directory structure for issue reviews
  $ mkdir -p /workspaces/vs-code-abl-2/issues/issue_#1/reviews
  └ 1 line...

Now let me create the comprehensive PRD review document:

● Create issues/issue_#1/reviews/prd_review_#1.md (+645)

Perfect! I've completed a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) review for Issue #1. The document includes:

## Summary of PRD Review

**Issue Status**: ✅ **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT** (Readiness Score: 8.5/10)

### Key Findings:

1. **Problem Well-Defined**: The issue identifies two specific user pain points with the current 'check syntax' command in multi-project workspaces

2. **Technical Solution Clear**: The codebase already has the infrastructure needed (`getProject()` function) - just needs smart integration into the command flow

3. **5 Detailed User Stories**: Each with testable acceptance criteria covering:
   - Auto-selection from file path
   - Default project override
   - Fallback to manual selection
   - Nested project handling
   - Single-project regression

4. **Comprehensive Edge Cases**: Analyzed 6 edge cases including symbolic links, nested projects, and platform-specific concerns

5. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, compatibility, UX, maintainability, and testability all defined

6. **5 Open Questions**: Flagged for product team decision before development starts (messaging, user control, priority logic, error handling, command consistency)

The document has been saved to: **`issues/issue_#1/reviews/prd_review_#1.md`**

This review provides the architecture team with everything needed to create implementation tasks while identifying the few product decisions that need stakeholder input first.
