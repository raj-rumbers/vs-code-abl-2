I'll help you create a comprehensive implementation plan for Plan #1. Let me start by analyzing the existing documentation and context.

● List directory plans
  └ 1 file found

● List directory plans/plan_1
  └ 2 files found

● Read plans/plan_1/issue.md
  └ 700 lines read

Now let me check if there's existing research, review, or tasks documentation:

● List markdown and yaml files in plan_1 directory
  $ ls -la /workspaces/vs-code-abl-2/plans/plan_1/ | grep -E '\.(md|yaml|yml)$'
  └ 2 lines...

Let me explore the codebase to understand the current implementation better:

● List directory src
  └ 11 files found

● Read src/extension.ts lines 367-402
  └ 36 lines read

● Find debug-related files in src
  $ find /workspaces/vs-code-abl-2/src -name "*Debug*" -o -name "*debug*" | head -20
  └ 3 lines...

● Read src/debugAdapter/ablDebugConfigurationProvider.ts lines 39-44
  └ 6 lines read

● Grep "getProject" (/workspaces/vs-code-abl-2/src)
  └ 32 lines found

● Read src/extension.ts lines 124-135
  └ 12 lines read

● Read src/extension.ts lines 1-50
  └ 50 lines read

Now let me check if there are other project-dependent commands to understand the scope better:

● Read src/extension.ts lines 405-510
  └ 106 lines read

Good! I can see there are multiple commands that use `getProject()` directly on the file path and just check if it's null. Now let me understand the project structure and gather more information:

● Read src/shared/openEdgeConfigFile.ts lines 1-80
  └ 80 lines read

● Find defaultProject references in extension.ts
  $ grep -n "defaultProject" /workspaces/vs-code-abl-2/src/extension.ts | head -20
  └ 5 lines...

Perfect! Now I have a good understanding of the codebase. Let me create a comprehensive research document and implementation plan. Let me start by creating the research document:

● Create plans/plan_1/research.md (+589)

Excellent! Now let me create the detailed phase breakdown with atomic, executable tasks. I'll create multiple phase files:

● Create plans/plan_1/phase_1.md (+561)

● Create plans/plan_1/phase_2.md (+706)

● Create plans/plan_1/phase_3.md (+870)

● Create plans/plan_1/phase_4.md (+775)

● Create plans/plan_1/phase_5.md (+809)

Perfect! Now let me create the consolidated tasks checklist file:

● Create plans/plan_1/tasks.md (+151)

Perfect! Now let me create a summary document that ties everything together:

● Create plans/plan_1/PLAN_SUMMARY.md (+293)

Excellent! Let me verify what we've created and provide a final summary:

● List all markdown files created for Plan #1
  $ ls -la /workspaces/vs-code-abl-2/plans/plan_1/ | grep -E '\.md$'
  └ 10 lines...

Perfect! Let me create a final index document to help navigate all the planning documents:

● Create plans/plan_1/README.md (+263)

Perfect! Now let me create a final summary of what has been accomplished:
