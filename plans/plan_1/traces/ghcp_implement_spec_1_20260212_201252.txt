I'll start by reviewing the plan folder to understand the tasks and requirements for this implementation.

● List directory plans/plan_1
  └ 11 files found

Let me review the key files to understand the scope and current progress:

● Read plans/plan_1/tasks.md
  └ 150 lines read

● Read plans/plan_1/issue.md
  └ 700 lines read

● Read plans/plan_1/phase_1.md
  └ 560 lines read

Now let me check Phase 2 to understand what needs to be done next:

● Read plans/plan_1/phase_2.md
  └ 705 lines read

Perfect! I can see that Phase 1 is complete and Phase 2 is ready to start. Let me check the current state of the repository to verify Phase 1 completion and begin Phase 2:

● Read src/shared/projectResolver.ts
  └ 207 lines read

● Check for recent neo commits
  $ cd /workspaces/vs-code-abl-2 && git log --oneline -20 --all | grep -i "\[neo\]"
  └ 3 lines...

Excellent! Phase 1 is complete. Now I'll begin Phase 2 by implementing the integration tasks. Let me start with TASK-009: Import Project Resolver Module.

● Read src/extension.ts lines 1-50
  └ 50 lines read

Now let me add the import for the project resolver module:

● Edit src/extension.ts (+1)

Now let me view the compileBuffer function to understand its current state:

● Read src/extension.ts lines 367-402
  └ 36 lines read

Perfect! Now I'll refactor the compileBuffer function according to the tasks. Let me implement all the changes at once:

● Edit src/extension.ts (+29 -20)

Now I need to add the showProjectSelectionDialog function right after compileBuffer:

● Edit src/extension.ts (+41)

Excellent! Now let me compile to verify there are no errors:

● Compile TypeScript and check for errors
  $ cd /workspaces/vs-code-abl-2 && npm run compile 2>&1 | head -50
  └ 6 lines...

Let me check what scripts are available:

● List available npm scripts
  $ cd /workspaces/vs-code-abl-2 && npm run 2>&1 | grep -E "^\s+"
  └ 13 lines...

I see - I need to use webpack, not compile. Let me also check the Makefile:

● Run linting to check for errors
  $ cd /workspaces/vs-code-abl-2 && make lint 2>&1 | tail -30
  └ 6 lines...

Great! The linting passes. Now let me commit this change and then write tests:
